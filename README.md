# NJTransit-Rail-Delay-Analysis
 
NJTransit is not operationally profitable, the government agency's cash flow is made up primarily by state funds, federal grants and fare revenue. In June 2024 NJT increased fares by 15%, with plans to increase it by 3% anually after. It is projected that in 2026 there will be a budget gap of $1 billion.

Not only are rail disruptions frustrating for passagers, but studies have found that they result in lower public transport usage. THE Federal Transit Administration uses formulas based on population, ridership, and other factors to allocate funds to states and transit agencies. It is of upmost importance for NJT to address delays as it is tied to customer satisfaction, financial performance, and operational efficiency.
